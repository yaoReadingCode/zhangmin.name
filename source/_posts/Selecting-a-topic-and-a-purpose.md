The first step of speechmaking is choosing a topic.There are two broad categories of potential topics:

*   (1)subjects you know a lot about and
*   (2)subjects you want to know more about.
If you have trouble picking a topic,you can use clustering,a personal inventory,or Internet search to come up with something that is right for you.
The general purpose of your speech will usually be to inform or to persuade.When your general purpose is to inform,your goal is to communicate information clearly ,accurately,and interestingly.When your general purpose is to persuade,your goal is to win listeners over to your point of view.
Once you know your topic and general purpose,you must focus on a specific purpose statement that indicates precisely what your speech seeks to achieve.The specific purpose statement should

*   (1)be a full infinitive phrase;
*   (2)be worded as a statement,not a question;
*   (3)avoid figurative language;
*   (4)not be vague or general;
*   (5)be appropriate for your audience;and
*   (6)be achievable in the allotted time.
The central idea is a concise statement of what you will say in your speech,and it usually crystallized in your thinking after you have done your research and have decided on the main points.In most cases,it encapsulates the main points in single declarative sentence.
**Following is a example:**
