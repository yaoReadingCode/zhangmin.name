When you speak to inform,your aim is to convey knowledge and understanding-not to advocate to a cause.Your speech will be judged in light of three general criteria:

Is the information communicated accurately?

Is the information communicated clearly?

Is the information communicated made meaningful and interesting to the audience?

There are many ways to classify informative speech.Here we focus on speeches about objects,processes,events,and concepts.

As the word is used here,"objects" include anything that is visible,tangible,and stable in form.Objects may have moving parts or be alive;they may include places,structures,animals,even people.

A process is a systematis series of actions that leads to a specific result or product.Speeches about process explain how something is made,how something is done,or how something works.

Concepts include beliefs,theories,ideas,principles,and the like.
