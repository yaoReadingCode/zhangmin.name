If you are like most people,you are nervous about the prospect of giving a speech in public.Stage fright is a global phenomenon that cuts across language,culture,and national borders.What the American comedian Jerry Seinfeld said in jest sometimes seems literally true:"Given a choice,at a funeral most of us would rather be the one in the coffin than the one giving the eulogy."
Stage fright is such a common occurence that even some of the greatest public speakers in history have suffered from it,including Mahatma Gandhi,Abraham Lincoln,and Winston Churchill.The famous Roman orator Cicero said,"I turn pale at the outset of a speech and quake in every limb and in my soul.Actually,most people tend to be anxious before doing something important in public.The ones who succeed have learned to use their nervousness to their advantage.Even most experienced speakers have stage fright before taking the floor,but their nervousness is a healthy sign that tey are getting "psyched up" for a good effort.In other words,it is perfectly normal——even desirable——to be nervous at the start of a speech.
Rather than trying to eliminate every trace of stage fright,you should aim at transforming it from a negagive force into what one expert calls positive nervouseness——"a zesty,enthusiasitic,lively feeling with a slight edge to it ...It's still nervouseness,but it feels different.You're no longer victimized by it;instead,you're vitalized by it.You're in control of it.
Here are a number of time-tested ways you can turn your nervouseness from a negative force into a positive one.

*   Acquire speaking experience.For most people,the biggest part of stage fright is fear of the unknown.Learning to give a speech is not much different from learning any other skill——it proceeds by trial and error.As time goes on,your fears about public speaking will grandually recede until they are replaced by only a healthy nervousness before you rise to speak.
*   Prepare,prepare,prepare.Pick speech topics you truly care about——and then to prepare yours speeches so thoroughly that you cannot help but be successful.One professional speech consultant estimates that preparation can reduce stage fright by up to 75 percent.
*   Think positively.Confidence is mostly the well-known power of positive thinking.If you think you can do it,you usually can.On the other hand,if you predict disaster and doom,that is almost always what you will get.
*   Use the power of visualization.The key to visualizatioin is creating a vivid mental blueprint in which you see yourself succeeding in your speech.
*   Know that most nervouseness is not visible.Only a fraction of the turmoil you feel inside is visible on the outside.
*   Don't expect perfection.Remember that audience does not know what the speaker plans to say,they only hear what the speaker does say.
*   Additional tips.They include:

    *   Be at your best physically and mentally.
    *   As you are waiting to speak,quietly tighten and relax your leg muscles,or squeeze your hands together and then release them.
    *   Take a couple slow,deep breaths before you start to speak.
    *   Work especially hard on your introduction.
    *   Make eye contact with members of your audience.
    *   Concentrate on communicating with your audience rather than on worrying about your stage fright.
    *   Use visual aids.
**<span style="color: #ff0000;">The best part about confidence is that it nurtures itself.After you score your first triumph,you will be that much more confident the next time,And as you become a more confident public speaker,you will likely become more confident in other areas of your life as well.</span>**
