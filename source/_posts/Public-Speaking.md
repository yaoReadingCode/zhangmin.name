For nations,as for individuals,public speaking is a vital way of expressing ideas and achieving objectives.What the Greek leader Pericles said more than 2,500 years ago is still true today:"One who forms a judgment on any point but cannot explain" it clearly "might as well never have thought at all on the subject."Public speaking,as its name implies,is a way of making your ideas public—of sharing them with other people and of influencing other people.

During modern times many woman and men around the globe have spread their ideas and influence through public speaking.The list includes Mahatma Gandhi,Eleanor Roosevelt,Winston Churchill,Nelson Mandela,Ronald Reagan,Martin Luther King,Bill Clinton,and Barack Obama.In China ,leader such as Sun Yat-sen,Mao Zedong,and Deng Xiaoping employed the power of the spoken word to change the course of history.

Public speaking is a form of empowerment.It can—and often does—make a difference in things people care about very much.Because you will live the rest of your life in a globalized world,the need for English public speaking will almost surely touch you at some time.To mention just a few situations,you might give a presentation at an international conference,a product demonstration to global buyers,a toast at a dinner in honor of foreign guests,or a tour of  a Chinese historic site for overseas friends or associates.
