The primary purpose of speechmaking is to give a favorable response from listeners.To be audience-centered,you need to keep following three question in mind when you work on your speeches.

1)To whom am I speaking.

2)What do I want them to know,believe,or do as a result of my speech.

3)What is the most effective way of composing and presenting my speech to accomplish that aim.

This article will intrduce the basic principles of audience analysis and adaption.

People are egocentric.They typically approach Â speech with one question uppermost in mind:"why is this important to me?"Harry Emerson Fosdick,the great American preacher,once said:"There is nothing that people are so interested in as themselves,their own problems,and the way to solve them.The fact is ...the primary starting point of all successful public speaking."Therefore,you need to strudy your audience and adapt your speech to their beliefs and interests.

The major factor to consider in audience analysis are size,physical setting,demographic traits,disposition toward the topic,disposition toward the speaker,and disposition toward the occasion.For speeches outside the classroom,you can get information about the audience by asking the person who invited you to speak.For classroom speeches,you can circulate an audience-analysis questionnaire.

Once you complete to audience analysis,you must adapt your speech so it will be clear and convincing.Try to hear the speech as yours listener will.Anticipate questions and objections,and try to answer them in advance.When you deliver your speech,keep an eye out for audience feedback,and adjust your remarks in response.After the speech,think about your audience's response and about changes you would make if you were delivering the speech again.
