Words are the tools of a speaker's craft.They have special uses,just like the tools of any other profession.Good speakers respect language and how it works.As a speaker you should use language accurately,clearly,vividly,appropriately,and inclusively.

Never use a word unless you are sure it is accurate.If you are not sure,look up the word in a dictionary.As you prepare your speeches,ask yourslef constantly,"What do I really want to say?What do I really mean?"

Using language clearly allows listeners to grasp your meaning immediately.You can ensure this by using words that are known to the average person and require no specialized background,by choosing concrete words in preference to some abstract ones,and by eliminating verbal clutter.

Using language vividly helps bring your speech to life.One way to make your language more vivid is through imagery,which you can develop by using concrete language,simile,and metaphor.Another way to make your speeches vivid is exploiting the rhythm of language with parallelism,repetition,alliteration,and antithesis.

Using language appropriately means adapting to the particular occasion,audience,and topic at hand.It also means developing your own language style instead of trying to copy someone else's.

Using language inclusively is an important element of intercultural communicative competence.Four strategies for inclusiveness are avoiding the generic "he",dropping the use of "man" when referring to both men and women,refraining from stereotyping jobs and social roles by gender,and using names that group use to identify themselves.
