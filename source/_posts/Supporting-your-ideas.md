Good speeches are not composed of hot air and generalizations.They need strong supporting material to answer the three questions listeners always ask of a speaker:"What do you mean?""Why should I believe you?""So what".The skillful use of supporting materials often makes the difference between a poor speech and a good one.In this article,we focus on three basic kinds of supporting material-examples,statistics,and testimony-and on general principles for using them effectively and responsibly.
**Examples**
One social psychologist has concluded that "most people are more deeply influenced by one clear,vivid,personal example than by an abundance of statistical."Examples are so important that many experienced speakers consider them "the very life of the speech".In addition to clarifying,personalizing,and reinforcing a speaker's ideas,they often appeal pwoerfully to our emotions.
There are three kinds of examples,including brief examples,extended examples and hypothetical examples.

*   Brief examples-also called specific instance-may be referred to in passing to illustrate a point.
*   Extended examples are often called narratives,illustrations,or anecdotes.
*   Hypothetical examples are ones that describe an imaginary situation
Tips for using examples:

*   Make examples vivid and richly textured.
*   Reinforce examples with statistics or testimony.
**Statistics**
We live in an age of statistics.Day in and day out we are bombarded with a staggering array of numbers.According to Lord Kelvin,the 19th-century physicist,"When you can measure what you are speaking about,and express in numbers,you know something about it.But when you cannot measure it,when you cannot express it in numbers,you knowledge is ...meager and unsatisfactory."It is widely shared belief that makes statistics,when used properly,such an effective way to clarify and support ideas.
Like brief examples,statistics are often cited in passing to clarify or strengthen a speaker's point.Statistics can also be used in combination to show the magnitude or seriousness of an issue.

Tips for using statistics:

*   Use representative statistics.
*   Identify the source of statistics.
*   Use statistics from reliable sources.
*   Round off complicated statistics.
*   Explain statistics.Statistics do not speak for themselves,They need to interpreted and related to your listeners.
*   Use visual aids to clarify statistics.
**Testimony**
We are often influenced by the testimony of other people.Just as you are likely to be swayed by your friend's recommendation about which class to take,so audience tend to respect the opinions of people who have special knowledge or experience on the topic at hand.By quoting or paraphrasing such people,you can give your ideas greater strength and impact.The two major kinds of testimony are expert testimony and peer testimony.
Citing the views of people who are experts-people who are acknowledged authorities in their field- is a good way to lend credibility to yours speeches.It shows that you are not just mouthing your own opinions,but that your position is supported by people who are knowledgeable about the topic.Another type of testimony often used in speeches is peer testimony-opinion of people like ourselves;not prominent figures,but ordinary citizens who have firsthand experience on the topic.This is kind of testimony is expecially valuable because it gives a more personal viewpoint on issues than can be gained from expert testimony.

Tip for using testimony:

*   Decide whether to quote or paraphrase.
*   Quote or paraphrase accurately.
*   Use testimony form qualified sources.
*   Use testimony from unbiased sources.
*   Identify the people you quote or paraphrase.
