Sperber and Wilson[1] proposed the relevance theory, which maintains that people understand natural language by attempting to extract the most information for the least processing cost. It follows, as a corollary of the theory, that, the closer a communication is to its intended meaning, the easier it is for a reader (or listener) to extract that meaning of the communication.If you want your communications to be easy to understand, then you should express them in a form that is close to their mental representations. They should be clear, so that extracting their meaning is easy, and they should be simple, so that their meaning is close to the canonical form in which they are represented.

In the case of the London underground Emergency Notice, the communication is easy to understand because its English sentences are structured explicitly or implicitly as logical conditionals.

_Press the alarm signal button to alert the driver.

The driver will stop if any part of the train is in a station.

If not, the train will continue to the next station,

where help can more easily be given.

There is a 50 pound penalty for improper use._

These Emergency Notice is relatively easy to understand,because its expression is relatively close to its intended meaning. Moreover, it is coherent, because the consecutive sentences are logically connected both
with one another and with the reader’s likely pre-existing goals and beliefs about what to do in an emergency.

Williams[2] emphasizes another way of achieving coherence: by placing old, familiar ideas at the beginning of sentences and new ideas at their end. In a succession of sentences, a new idea at the end of one sentence becomes an old idea that can be put at the beginning of the next sentence.The first three sentences of the Emergency Notice illustrate Williams’ advice.
