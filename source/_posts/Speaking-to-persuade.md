Persuasion is the process of creating,reinforcing,or changing people's beliefs or actions.When you speak to persuade,you act as an advocate.Your job is to get listeners to agree with you and ,perhaps,to act on that belief.Persuasive speaker need skills that take you from giving information to affecting your listeners' attitude,beliefs,or actions.As with other kinds of public speaking,you are more likely to be effective at persuasion if you approach it systematically and with clear understanding of the methods available to you.

**The Psychology of Persuasion**

Persuasion is something a speaker does with an audience.Listeners do not sit passively and soak in everything a speaker has to say.Instead,they engage in the mental give-and-take with the speaker.They may respond positively at one point,negatively at another inside their minds.

It means you must think of your persuasive speech as a kind of a mental dialogue with your audience.You must anticipate possible objections the audience will raise to your point of view and then answer those objections in your speech.You cannot covert skeptical listeners unless you deal directly with the reasons for their skepticism.

**The Target Audience**

Unfortunately,no matter how carefully you plot your speech,you will seldom be able to persuade all your audience.The target audience is the portion of the whole audience that you most wants to persuade.In most cases,the target audience will consist of people who are opposed to or neutral toward the speaker's position.

**Persuasive Speeches on Questions of Fact**

The situation for a persuasive speech on a question of fact is partisan.The speaker acts as an advocate.His or her aim is not to be impartial but to present one view of the facts as persuasively as possible.

**Persuasive Speeches on Questions of Value**

Questions of value are not simply matters of personal opinion or whim.Instead they are claims that you must justify.For example,if you say,"Bicycle riding is the ideal form of land transportation ".Whenever you give a speech on a question of value,be sure to give special thought to the standards for you value judgement.The most common approach is to devote your first main point to establishing the standards for your value judgement and you second main point to applying those standards to the subject of your speech.

**Persuasive Speeches on Questions of Policy**

Questions of policy deals with specific courses of action.They always go beyond question of fact or value to decide whether something should or should not be done.

There are two types of speeches on questions of policy:

1.  Speeches to gain passive agreement.You try to get your audience to agree with you that a certain policy is desirable,but you will not necessarily encourage the audience to do anything to enact the policy.
2.  Speeches to gain immediate action.You want to do more than get your listeners to nod their heads in agreement.If you want to motivate them to act you should make your recommendations as specific as possible.

Effective organization is crucial when you seek to persuade listeners on a question of policy.There are four special patterns which are especially valuable for policy speeches:

1.  Problem-solution order.In the first of your main point, you demonstrate the need for a new policy by showing the extent and seriousness of the problem.In the second main point,you explain your plan for solving the problem.
2.  Problem-cause-solution order.A variation of the problem-solution order which produces a speech with three main points-the first identifying a problem,the second analyzing the causes of the problem,and the third presenting a solution to the problem.
3.  Comparative advantages order.When your audience already agrees that a problem exists,you can devote your speech to comparing the advantages and disadvantages of competing solutions.
4.  Motivated sequence.It is a tailor-made for policy speeches that seek immediate action.It has five steps that follow the psychology of persuasion:

*   Attention.Gain attention.
*   Need.Make the audience feel a need for a change.
*   Satisfaction.Satisfy the need by providing a solution.
*   Visualization.Intensify desire by visualizing the benefits of the solution.
*   Action.Say exactly what you want listeners to do and how to do it.Then conclude with a final stirring appeal that reinforces their commitment to act.

**Methods of Persuasion**

A speaker will be persuaded for one or more of following four reasons:

1.  Because they perceive the speaking as  having high credibility.
2.  Because they are won over by the speaker's evidence.
3.  Because they are convinced by the speaker's ideas or language.
4.  Because their emotions are touched by the speaker's ideas or language.

Let us look at each in turn.

Credibility is affected by two factors:

1.  competence.how an audience regards a speaker's intelligence,expertise,and knowledge of the subject.
2.  character.how an audience regards a speaker's sincerity,trustworthiness,and concern for the well-being of the audience.

To enhance you credibility you can explain your competence,establish common ground with your audience and deliver your speeches fluently,expressively,and with conviction.

Evidence consists of supporting materials-examples,statistics,testimony-used to prove or disprove something.You should use specific,novel,and credible evidence.

Reasoning is the process of drawing a conclusion on the basis of evidence.As a public speaker,you have two major concerns with respect to reasoning.First,you must make sure your own reasoning is sound.Second,you must try to get listeners to agree with your reasoning.There are four basic methods of reasoning:reasoning from specific instances,reasoning from principle,causal reasoning and analogical reasoning.

When you reason from specific instances,you should follow the follow three basic guidelines:

First,avoid generalizing too hastily.Make sure your sample of specific instance is large enough to justify you conclusion.

Second,make sure the instances you present are fair,unbiased,and representative.

Third,reinforce your argument with statistics or testimony.

Emotional appeals are usually inappropriate in a persuasive speech on a question of fact.Here you should deal only in specific information and logic.On the other hand,if you want to move people to act a question of policy,emotional appeal are not only legitimate but perhaps necessary.You will need to appeal to your listeners' hearts as well as to their heads.

Even when trying to move listeners to action,however,you should never substitute emotional appeals for evidence and reasoning.You should always build your persuasive speech on a firm foundation of facts and logic.You need a good case based on reason and kindle the emotions of your audience.
