Good afternoon,everyone.I’m very glad and also nervous to give my self-introduction speech.First of all, I’d like to talk about my name.My name is ZhangMin.Hearing this name,you may remember that you hava a classmate or schoolmate whose name was same as mine.If you haven’t had one yet,don't worry,you will eventually have one.You may wonder how many people have the name ZhangMin in China.Let me tell you,the number is 250,000.Trouble arise when get such a popular name.I don't remember how many times my gender was mistakenly written and how difficult to select a id for my social network account.Also,Questions are asked when people know where I come from.For example,Do you see the beautiful grassland?Can you speak Mongolian?How about your horseback experience?When all the answers were negative,I even start to doubt whether I’m a Inner Mongolian.There is a joke about the misunderstanding of life in Inner Mongolia.It says:
People live in Inner Mongolia ride the horse to work.They stop at the crossrode waiting for the traffic light to turn green.When it turns green, they galloped off at full speed.
This is me,name after a popular name and as one of the Inner Mongolian who have no horseback experience till now.Thank you all.
