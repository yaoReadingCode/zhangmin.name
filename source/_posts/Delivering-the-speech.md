**What is a good delivery**

Good delivery does not call attention to itself.It conveys the speaker's idea clearly,interestingly,and without distracting the audience.Most audiences prefer delivery that combines a certain degree of formality with the best attributes of good conversation-directness,spontaneity,animation,vocal and facial expressiveness and a lively sense of communication.

Speech is an art,not a science.There is no substitute for experience.But take heart,a textbook can give you basic pointer to get you started in the right direction.

**Methods of delivery**

*   Reading from a manuscript.In situations that absolute accuracy is essential.
*   Reciting from memory.Make brief presentations such as toasts,congratulatory remarks,acceptance speeches,introductions,and the like.
*   Speaking impromptu.Practice makes perfect.
*   Speaking extemporaneously.Popular usage.Carefully prepared and practiced in advance,presenting with a set of brief notes to job the memory.

**The speaker's voice**

The aspects of voice you should work to control are volume,pitch,rate,pauses,variety,pronunciation and articulation(the physical production of particular speech sounds).

**The speaker's body**

Posture,facial expression,gesture and eye contact.

**Practicing delivery**

Popular wisdom promises that practice makes perfect,This is true,but only if we practice properly.

Five-step method:

1.  Go through your preparation outline aloud to check how it translates into spoken discourse.
2.  Prepare your speaking outline.
3.  Practice the speech aloud several times using only the speaking outline.
4.  Now begin to polish and refine your delivery.
5.  Finally,give your speech a dress rehearsal under conditions as close as possible you will face on speech day.

**Always remember:start early.A single practice session-no matter how long-is rarely enough.**
