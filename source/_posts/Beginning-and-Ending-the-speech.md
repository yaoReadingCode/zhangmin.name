Speeches need appropriate beginnings and endings.The beginning,or introduction,prepares listeners for what is to come.The conclusion ties up everything and alerts listeners that the speech is going to end.
In this article we will explore the roles played by an introduction and conclusion in speechmaking and discuss techniques aimed at fulfilling those roles.If you apply these techniques imaginatively,you will take a big step toward elevating yours speeches from the ordinary to the splendid.
**Introduction**
First impressions are important.A poor beginning may so distract or alienate listeners that the speaker will never fully recover.Moreover,getting off on the right foot is vital to a speaker's self-confidence.
In most speech situations,the introduction has four objectives.

*   Get the attention and interest of your audience.
*   Create a positive relationship with the audience.
*   Establish your credibility.
*   Preview the body of the speech.
**Tips for the introduction**

*   Keep the introduction relatively brief.
*   Be on the lookout for possible introductory material as you do your research.File them with your notes so they will be handy when you are ready for them.
*   Don't worry about the exact wording of your introduction until you have finished preparing the body of the speech.
*   Don't apologize in your introduction.Such apologize weaken your credibility and give teh audience little reason to pay attention to the rest of your speech.
*   Work out your introduction in detail.
*   Don't start talking too soon.
**Conclusion**
The conclusion of your speech is the last chance to drive home your ideas.Moreover,your final impression will probably linger in your listeners' minds.Thus,you need to craft your colsing remarks with as much care as your introduction.
No matter what kind of speech you are giving,the conclusion has two major function:

*   To let the audience know you are ending the speech.
*   To reinforce the audience's understanding of,or commitment to,the central idea.
**Tips for the conclusion**

*   As with the introduction,keep an eye out for possible concluding material as you research and develop the speech.
*   Conclude with a bang,not a whimper.
*   Don't be long-winded.
*   Don't end with an apologize.If you don't believe in your speech,your listeners won't either.
*   Don't leave anything in your conclusion to chance.Work it out in detail,and give yourself plenty of time to practice delivering it.
