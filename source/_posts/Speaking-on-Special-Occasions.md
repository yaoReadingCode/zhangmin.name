Special occasions are the punctuation marks of day-to-day life,the high points that stand out above ordinary routine.Weddings,graduations,award ceremonies,retirement dinners,anniversaries,funerals - all are special occasions to the people who participate in them.The speeches in these occasions are part of the ceremonial aura that make the event.

**Speeches of Introduction**

A speech of introduction is an address that introduces the main speaker to the audience.If you present such an address,you need to accomplish three purpose:

*   Build enthusiasm for the upcoming speaker.
*   Build enthusiasm for the  speaker's topic.
*   Establish a welcoming climate that will boost the speaker's credibility.

Your speech of introduction should:

*   Be brief.
*   Make sure your remarks are completely accurate.
*   Adapt your remarks to the occasion.
*   Adapt your remarks to the main speaker.
*   Adapt your remarks to the audience.
*   Try to create a sense of anticipation and drama.The speaker's name comes as the climax of your introduction.

**Speech of Presentation and Acceptance**

Speeches of presentation are given when someone receives a gift,an award,or some other form of public recognition.The main objection of such a speech is to acknowledge the recipient's achievement.In contrast,the purpose of an acceptance speech is to give thanks for a gift or an award.It should be brief,humble,and gracious.

**Toast**

Toasts can run from one or two sentences to several minutes.Regardless of length,they should be warm and sincere.When give a toast in a across-cultural situation,be sure to check in advance any special phrases or pronunciations associated with the toast.

**Commemorative Speech**

A commemorative speech is an address of praise or celebration.It should inspire the audience,and its success depends largely on how well the speaker puts into language the thought and feelings appropriate to the occasion.
