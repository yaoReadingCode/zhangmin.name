Listeners demand coherence.Just as a director must be sure viewers can follow the plot of a film from beginning to end,so must a speaker be sure listeners can follow the progression of ideas in a speech from beginning to end.This requires that speeches be organized strategically.They should be put together in a particular ways to achieve particular result with particular audiences.
Speech organization is important for others reasons as well.It is closely connected to critical thinking.In addition,using a clear,specific method of speech organization can boost your credibility ,your confidence,and your abillity to deliver a message fluently.
The process of organizing the body of speech begins when you determine the main points.The main points are the central features of your speech.You should select them carefully,phrase them precisely,and arrange them strategically.Sometimes they will be evident from your specific purpose statement.Even if your main points are not stated expressly in your specific purpose,they may be easy to project from it.
**Strategically order of main points**
Once you establish your main points,you need to decide the order in which you will present them.The most effective order depends on three things-your topic,your purpose,and your audience.Here we look briefly at the four basic patterns of organization used most often by public speakers.

*   Chronological order.Speeches arranged chronologically follow a time pattern.They may narrate a series of events in the sequence in which they happened.It is also used in speeches explaining a process or demonstrating how to do something.
*   Spatial order.Speeches arranged in spatial order follow a directional pattern.That is,the main points proceed from top to bottom,left to right,front to back,inside to outside,east to west,or some other route.
*   Problem-solution order.Speeches arranged in problem-solution order are divided into two main parts-the existence and seriousness of a problem and a workable solution to the problem.
*   Topical order.Topical order results when you divide the speech topic into subtopics,each of which becomes a main point in the speech.Notice the logic and consistency of the subtopics you subdivided from main points.Because it is applicable to almost any subject and to any kind of speech,topical order is used more often than any other method of speech organization
**Tips for preparing main points**

*   Limit the number of main points.In most cases,a speech will contain from two to five main points.
*   Keep main points separate.Each main points in a speech should be clearly independent of the others.
*   Try to use the same pattern of wording for main points.
*   Balance the amount of time devoted to main points.Be sure they all receive enough emphasis to be clear and convicing.
**Supporting materials**
Organizing your supporting materials directly relevant to the main points they are supposed to support.See also [Supporting your ideas](http://www.zhangmin.name/blog/2013/04/supporting-your-ideas/).
**Connectives**
Once you have organized your main points and supporting points,you must give attention to the third element in the body of a speech-connectives.Connectives are words or phrases that join one thought to another and indicate the relationship between them.Four types of speech connectives are transitions,internal previews,internal summaries,and signpost.

*   <transitions.Transitions are words or phrases that indicate when a speaker has completed one thought and is moving on to another.Technically,transitions state both the idea the speaker is leaving and the idea he or she is coming up to.
*   Internal previews.Internal previews let the audience know what the speaker will take up next,but they are more detailed than transitions.
*   Internal summaries.Internal summaries are the reverse of internal previews.Rather than letting listeners know what is coming up next,internal summaries remind listeners of what they have just heard.
*   Signposts.Signposts are very brief statements that indicate exactly where you are in the speech.Frequently they are just numbers.Another way to accomplish the same thing is to introduce your main points with a question.Besides using signposts to indicate where you are in the speech,you can use them to focus attention on key ideas.
