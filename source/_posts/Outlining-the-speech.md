Just as plans and blueprints are essential to architecture,so are outlines essential to successful speeches.An outline is like a blueprint for your speech.It allows you to see a full scope and content of your speech at a glance and helps you make sure that related items are together,that ideas flow from one to another,that the structure of your speech will "stand up"-and not collapse.

In most cases,you will use two kinds of outlines for your speeches-one very detailed,for the planning stage,and one very brief,for the delivery of the speech.

Writing a preparation outline means putting your speech together-deciding what you will say in the introduction,how you will organize the main points and supporting materials in the body,and what you will say in the conclusion.

Followings are some guidelines for the preparation outline.

*   State the specific purpose and central idea.
*   Label the introduction,body,and conclusion.
*   Use a consistent pattern of symbolization and indentation.
*   State main point and subpoint in full sentences.
*   Label transitions,internal summaries,and internal previews.
*   Attach a bibliography.
*   Give your speech a title.

However,the aim of a speaking outline,a condensed version of your preparation outline, is to help you remember what you want to say.It should contain key words or phrases to jog your memeory,as well as essential statistics and quotations that you don't want to risk forgetting.

You may develop your own variations on the speaking outline,but as beginner your best bet is follow the basic guidelines below:

*   Follow the visual framework used in the preparation outline.
*   Make sure the outline is legible.
*   Keep the outline as brief as possible.
*   Give yourself cues for delivering the speech.
